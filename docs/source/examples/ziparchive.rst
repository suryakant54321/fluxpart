High-frequency data in ZIP archive
----------------------------------
In the Tutorial :ref:`tutorial-example`, the high-frequency data files were
located in a file directory. The same analysis could be done if the files were
in a ZIP archive. Here, we assume the name of the archive is my_archive.zip,
and that it is located in ``/home/todd/data``. The wrapper function
``my_partition`` from the Tutorial :ref:`tutorial-example` is assumed to be
already defined. This code produces the same results as obtained in the
Tutorial :ref:`tutorial-example`:

.. code-block:: python

    import datetime
    import os
    import zipfile

    fpout = []
    DATADIR = "/home/todd/data"
    zip_archive = 'my_archive.zip.zip'
    with zipfile.ZipFile(os.path.join(DATADIR, zip_archive), 'r') as arch:
        for dd in range(5, 14):
            for hh in range(0, 24):
                for mm in range(0, 60, 15):
                    filename = "TOA5_6843.ts_Above_2012_06_{:02}_{:02}{:02}.dat".format(dd, hh, mm)
                    with arch.open(filename, 'r') as datafile:
                        timestamp = datetime.datetime(2012, 6, dd, hh, mm)
                        fpout.append(my_partition(datafile, timestamp))
