For novice Python/SciPy users
-----------------------------

**Fluxpart** is a Python 3 module. Using it requires a `Python language`_
interpreter as well as a few standard scientific Python libraries (SciPy_).

The recommended way to install **fluxpart** and create the required
computational environment is to use conda_, an open source package and
environment management system that works on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. Conda
can be obtained by installing miniconda_, a small Python distribution that
includes conda and a Python interpreter (alternatively, conda can be obtained
by installing the larger anaconda_ distribution). Miniconda installs and
operates at the user level, so its installation and use does not require
administrator rights, nor will it affect other OS-level Python installations
already on your machine.  If miniconda (or anaconda) is already installed on
your machine, skip the next paragraph.

Follow the instructions for your operating system on the miniconda_ quick start
page for downloading and installing.  We advise choosing the latest Python 3.x
installer (**not** Python 2.7).

Verify that conda is installed by opening a terminal emulator (command prompt
window) and entering at the command line::

    conda --version

Conda should respond with the version number of the installed package (e.g.,
``conda 4.1.12``). If you have an older, previously installed version of conda,
it is advised to update it  with::

    conda update conda

Next, install ``anaconda-client`` into the root environment::

    conda install anaconda-client

Finally, create a conda environment containing **fluxpart** and its
dependencies, as well as some useful libraries for plotting and analysis
(Matplotlib_, Jupyter_), by entering::

    conda env create ussl/fluxpart

To activate the **fluxpart** environment, enter:

    Linux, Mac OS X:::

        source activate fluxpart

    Windows::

        activate fluxpart

The command line prompt should now be prepended with ``(fluxpart)``, indicating
that the **fluxpart** environment is active in the shell session.

If you are new(ish) to Python_, a good tool for learning and interactively
building-up **fluxpart** analyses is the `Jupyter notebook`__. The notebook
can be launched from the command line of an active **fluxpart** environment
with::

    jupyter notebook

__ Jupyter_

See the `Jupyter documentation`_ for getting started with the notebook, and the
**fluxpart** :ref:`fluxpart-tutorial` for getting started with
**fluxpart**.

If at some point it is desired to deactivate the **fluxpart**  environment,
then:

    Linux, Mac OS X::

        source deactivate

    Windows::

        deactivate
